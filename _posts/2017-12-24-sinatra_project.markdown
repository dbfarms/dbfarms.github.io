Hello! So a frustration for farmers is having to dispose of seconds produce that, for one reason or another, can't be delivered to foodbanks in time... though we don't really throw anything out, the rotten produce gose to compost and having a healthy compost pile is good practice.  

Foodbanks are few in number and have a limited window for when they can/will accept food deliveries, and farmers never have enough time in the day. 

The point of this project was to use the MVC and activerecords to create a relationship between when farmers have time to deliver, when foodbanks are open, and to provide a calendar to explore those overlaps. Eventually I see this project going in a slightly different direction, though by and large the relationships established here will remain relavent. 

Eventually I'd like to tie in the Google Maps API in order to plot routes based on location and time, as well as adding a component for working collectively with another farm, the size of the van/box truck, etc etc. 

This can be geared towards various organization that already do these deliveries on behalf of farms/foodbanks, but don't have the tech in place to make it efficient, or for farmers to work collectively to help each other based on resources available. 

Thanks for reading!
