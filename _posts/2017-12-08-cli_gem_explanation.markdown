This is the attendant blog post for the CLI Gem deal. 


Whipped up a very simple look at current trends on Twitter. The gem was specifically geared towards hashtags surrounding fake news to get a survey of various perspectives on what is/isn't/might well be fake news (but really, who can say? what do any of us know but what we're trained to... etc etc). 

Then I realized it'd be easy to let the user put in their own word(s) to find trends that they were interested in. While this is a worse version of the search feature on Twitter itself, it a) demonstrates the required scraping and b) will eventually be a foundation for a larger, more useful program I hope to make once I'm skilled with Rails.

Thanks for reading!
