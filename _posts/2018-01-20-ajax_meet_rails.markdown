Gave my rails app a nice and shiny ajax overhaul. Kept the designing to a non-existent minimum (default gray and unappealing buttons abound...), but I'm more interested in the backend mechanics at this point in time. That said, the basscss stuff looks real interesting, but (among other things, many many other things), what I feel I've learned the most so far is how to look at documentation and not have my brain shrivel up at the new jargon. That's a plus! 

It always surprises me how much more I know when push-comes-to-shove and all that, when I've gotta wing these things on my own without Ask A Question help. Feels alright! But seriously, the repetition and muslce memory typing and retyping of similar AJAX was a necessary thing. I'm really excited for the next sections and to keep building on what I've learned so far. 

I haven't bothered to explain the purpose of this app since it hasn't at all changed since the last post, so please refer to that for more information. 

Thanks!
