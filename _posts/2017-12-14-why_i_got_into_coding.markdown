So  really it's more 'why I got back into coding', because half a liftime ago I was spending most of my time in high school coding(C++, Java).  College was an opportunity to try new things, so I took a left-turn and found myself as a journalist, which was pretty good work for a while...  but I wrote about politics, and politicians are an unpleasant group (the lying and the back-stabbing and I can go on), and then I also wrote about the environment (news alert: we're kinda screwed on that front, too)..  so I made another left-turn, this time into farming. 

Which, it turns out, has so much more to do with politics than it should (like, you know, the farm bill, and Big Ag, and the union, and gov't's role in policy, not to mention undocumented workers and their rights, and how much people expect to pay for food vs. how much it costs to produce, and on and on and on). 

But even more than politicians, tech folk entered my life in a big way once I got into farming. Indeed- there are numerous startups involved with food, in fact they're so common I won't even mention any in particular because I'm sure one's already come to mind. The thing is, those tech folks were mostly interested in making lots of money. Meantime farm wages are low. So there seemed to be a missing link between making lots of money 'disrupting' models of food distro by utilizing newer and more efficient and intelligent infrastructure, and actually supporting the people whose hands are literally quite filthy most of the time (but totally filthy in a different and superior way to the filthy hands of the politicians on whom I once reported, etc etc).

Seemed to me like there was a good opening to learn the tech-side (about which I was already inclined, see above) and pair with what I know about farming. 

It's also the winter right now and most relatively-new farmers need a side hustle come winter time because, well, yeah, duh, there isn't much scratch in this career. So, failing to develop a revolutionary approach to farm-meets-tech, this coding thing seems like a useful skill to have. Also I need to rest my joints, and sitting around is good recovery from a season of back-breaking, sun-scorching summers. But I jest, farming is great, maybe go out and volunteer on a farm sometime, it'll be a blast. 

So, that's about that. 

Thanks for reading!
