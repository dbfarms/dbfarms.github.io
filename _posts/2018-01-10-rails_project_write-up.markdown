Hello reader: it's done, finally, finally, finally. Took some doing but we got there. Tried a marathon sesh yesterday in an attempt to get it in a single day but only got 75% there, so had to wrap it in day 2. Bugs and unexpected problems and last-minute 'oh let's throw this in there' but hey, surprise: think these things out before just winging it. We'll get there yet. 

So, this is a stripped down version of a future project I intend to make once I'm out of Flatiron and ready to learn Google Maps API: an organizing / routing / mapping tool for various functions and numerous features and so on and so forth. Think visiting a new city and getting recommendations from friends of where to go, and following that route. Largely meant for pub crawls, also useful for cultural interests. I don't dictate how these things be used, just advise. 

In other news, I think I need a standing desk. I dunno, is that just a gimmick? Thoughts?
