So for my final project I had a number of different projects I was considering, which made choosing one difficult, but it also makes the prospect for my future coding  career (i.e. keeping busy) looking alright. I keep learning new things, or relearning things, or solidifying in my mind concepts previously I had trouble fully wrapping my head around. Things keep clicking, which has that gooey/rewarding feeling going day-in-day-out. As to the project: 

I decided on a store, because I have real and immediate need for this, so why not kill two birds with one project and make something I intend to use one day? Right now I have the Rails concepts on lock, and everyday React is a day of learning new tricks, but conceptually it's al clicking as well. Everytime I feel a bit out of my depth until it comes to doing the portfolio project on my own, then I realize how much more I do than I thought. That said, my design skills leave something (Everything?) to be desired. I'll spend more time on that as soon as I complete Flatiron. 

What else to say? Not much! Explore the store, it'll be for farmers selling off farmboxes on days after markets so less food goes to waste. 

Thanks for reading.
